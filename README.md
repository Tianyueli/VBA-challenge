* Context: This stock market dataset contains a list of stocks and their corresponding  transaction pricing and volume changes on a daily basis.

* Finding Explanation: 
    * This analysis pinpointed the stocks with the greatest increase and the greatest decrease within year 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, it highlighted the specific stocks generating the most transaction volume in each year.
    *    For example, in year 2020, the stock with the highest growth was Ticker YDI. It increased 188.76% in value and indicates high profitability.
    *    Ticker QKN reached the highest total transaction volume among all stocks in year 2020, which could indicate high liquidity and a high interest from buyers competing for this asset.
    * Potential restraints of this finding:
    *    Due to the limit of the assignment, findings are targeted to track the yearly open / close pricing change between beginning of the year to end of the year. It could provide additional insight if we also analyzed the annual pricing variance between the highest and lowest pricing points for each stock.
